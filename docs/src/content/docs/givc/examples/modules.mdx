### Import GIVC

GIVC exposes NixOS modules, which are primarily aimed to be used with the [Ghaf Framework](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf).

If you are using the Ghaf Framework as a library, the default functionality should be available without further modification.
However, to include it into your project, define your flake input as follows

```nix
givc = {
  url = "github:tiiuae/ghaf-givc";
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";          # optional
    flake-utils.follows = "flake-utils";  # optional
    devshell.follows = "devshell";        # optional
    treefmt-nix.follows = "treefmt-nix";  # optional
  };
};
```

To use the givc flake overlay, overlay your nixpkgs with the givc overlay:

```nix
nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.givc.overlays.default ];
```

### Import Modules

You can import the givc modules individually, or create an internal module importing all givc modules at once and enable the respective module where needed.

#### Option 1: Individual Import

To import a givc module, simply add the respective module to your imports statement in the relevant VM or host.

Example: Import admin module to admin-vm
```nix
imports = [
  inputs.givc.nixosModules.admin
];
```
This allows you to import a modules where needed, and applies analogously to all VMs and host.

#### Option 2: Internal Module

You can alternatively create an internal module, and import this module anywhere a givc module is needed. It can then be
enabled and configured in the config section. Here an example how to create such a module with [flake-parts](https://flake.parts/):
```nix
{ inputs, ... }:
{
  flake.nixosModules = {
    givc.imports = [
      inputs.givc.nixosModules.admin
      inputs.givc.nixosModules.host
      inputs.givc.nixosModules.tls
      inputs.givc.nixosModules.dbus
      inputs.givc.nixosModules.sysvm
      inputs.givc.nixosModules.appvm
    ];
  };
}
```

The givc module of your project is then exported, and can typically be referenced internally as
```nix
inputs.self.nixosModules.givc
```
### Module Configuration

> **IMPORTANT**
> Please refer to the developer documentation for detailed documentation of the NixOS modules; and examine the configurations of the [automated tests](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf-givc/tree/main/nixos/tests) or the [Ghaf project](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf/tree/main/modules/givc) as reference.

Once you have imported a givc module, you need to configure it. Module configuration should be straightforward; generally, all modules requires at least:

* enabling the module
* configuring its network paramters
* configuring TLS paths (if different from defaults)

In addition, agents typically require:

* configuring the admin service network parameters (where to reach it)
* configuring systemd units, services, and/or applications that it administers
* enabling additional agent modules (such as dbus or locale services)

#### Example: Host Module
As an example, we configure the systems `host` module. Compared to the `sysvm` module, it has additional functionality to control VM services (`microvm@<vm-name>.service`), and TLS credential generation. Only one host module should be present at a time.

A sample host module configuration could look like this:

```nix
# Configure givc host module
givc.host = {
    # Enable module
    enable = true;

    # Define modules' server configuration
    transport = {
        name = "my-host";
        addr = "192.168.1.2";
        port = "9000";
    };

    # Provide list of services to whitelist for the module
    services = [
        "a-host-service.service"
        "poweroff.target"
        "reboot.target"
    ];

    # Provide a list of system and app VMs
    systemVms = map (vmName: "microvm@${vmName}.service") [ "admin-vm" "net-vm" ];
    appVms = map (vmName: "microvm@${vmName}.service") [ "app-vm" ];

    # Provide TLS configuration files
    tls = {
        caCertPath = "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt";
        certPath = "/etc/givc/ghaf-host-cert.pem";
        keyPath = "/etc/givc/ghaf-host-key.pem";
    };

    # Provide admin service information
    admin = {
        name = "admin-vm";
        addr = "192.168.1.3";
        port = "9001";
    };

    # Provide a TLS generator configuration
    givc.tls = {
    enable = true;
    agents = lib.attrsets.mapAttrsToList (n: v: {
        name = n;
        addr = v;
    }) {
        net-vm = "192.168.1.1";
        my-host = "192.168.1.2";
        admin-vm = "192.168.1.3";
        app-vm = "192.168.1.4";
    };
    generatorHostName = "my-host";
    storagePath = "/vm-storage/givc";
    };
};
```

The system VM module (`sysvm`) is used and configured the similar as the host module, and only differs by type and subsequent parent process (VM) information.

The `admin` module is configured similar to the `host` module. Services defined with the `admin` module are expected to be givc agent modules that report to the admin VM as part of the system startup.

#### Example: Appvm Module

The `appvm` module runs as user service in an active user session, not as a system service. The implementation allows to specify and run multiple applications.

To use the agent as application controller, include the `appvm` module as follows:

```nix
# Configure appvm module
givc.appvm = {
    # Enable module
    enable = true;

    # UID of user to determine session bus
    uid = 1000;

    # Define modules' server configuration
    transport = {
        name = "app-vm";
        addr = "192.168.1.123";
        port = "9000";
    };

    # Specify applications by name, command, and argument types accepted
    applications = [
        {
            name = "foot";
            command = "${pkgs.foot}/bin/foot";
            args = [ "flag" ];
        }
    ];

    # Provide TLS configuration files
    tls = {
        caCertPath = "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt";
        certPath = "/etc/givc/ghaf-host-cert.pem";
        keyPath = "/etc/givc/ghaf-host-key.pem";
    };

    # Provide admin service information
    admin = {
        name = "admin-vm";
        addr = "192.168.1.3";
        port = "9001";
    };
};
```

Note that a user session must be active for the systemd service to run. Depending on your system's user configuration, you can use `loginctl enable-linger $USER`, the `users.users.<name>.linger` NixOS option, or

```nix
systemd.tmpfiles.rules = [
    "f /var/lib/systemd/linger/${my-user}"
];
```

to keep the user session running without requiring additional login and keep the user service agent running.
